    "resposta": "Category: CAT1: Account Compromise\nExplanation: The incident description indicates that a machine (identified by IP address) is performing malicious activities, and it is suspected that the machine may have been compromised or is being used as a base for attacks. The logs provided show multiple SYN packets being sent from the machine to various IP addresses, which is indicative of a potential SSH brute force attack. This type of activity aligns with the definition of Account Compromise, specifically SSH brute force, which is listed as an example under CAT1.\n\nThe description mentions that \"A maquina em questao foi vitima de um ataque de forca bruta contra o SSH,\" which translates to \"The machine in question was a victim of a brute force attack against SSH.\" This directly supports the classification under CAT1: Account Compromise, as it explicitly mentions a brute force attack against SSH, a common method used to compromise accounts. \n\nTherefore, the category CAT1: Account Compromise is the most appropriate classification for this incident."

This aligns with the definition of CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts, and one of its examples is SSH brute force. \n\nThe description provided indicates that an IP address (`IP_ADDRESS_907d29be4d`) was involved in multiple connection attempts to various destinations on port 3306, which seems to be a scanning or probing activity, often associated with brute-force attacks. Additionally, it mentions that the CERT.br received logs showing malicious activities possibly originating from the compromised machine, suggesting unauthorized access. Therefore, categorizing this incident as CAT1 is appropriate due to the involvement of a brute-force attack against SSH, which can lead to unauthorized access to accounts."

This malware is described as a backdoor typically used for lateral movement within a victim's network and has been associated with ransomware attacks like Ryuk and Egregor. The recommended actions include blocking mentioned Windows accounts, disconnecting infected computers from the network, verifying data backups, investigating other potential compromises, and reinstalling infected machines. These actions are directly related to responding to a malware infection.\n\nThe description fits well with the examples provided for CAT2, which include ransomware and Trojan horses, as SystemBC can act similarly to these types of malicious software.

SystemBC is described as a backdoor typically used for lateral movement within a victim's network, often associated with ransomware attacks like Ryuk and Egregor. The recommended actions include blocking mentioned Windows accounts, disconnecting infected computers from the network, verifying data backups, investigating other potential compromises, and reinstalling infected machines. These actions are directly related to responding to a malware infection.\n\nThe description provided aligns with the definition of CAT2: Malware – infection by malicious code, as it involves infection by malicious code (SystemBC malware), which is a type of malicious software (backdoor) used for unauthorized access and control of the infected systems. Examples given for CAT2 include ransomware and Trojan horses, which are also types of malware, supporting the classification of this incident as CAT2."

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.

    "resposta": "Category: CAT3: Denial of Service Attack\n\nExplanation: The incident description clearly indicates that a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, was launched using a botnet that included a compromised host with the IP address [IP_ADDRESS_2a7591facb]. The attack was aimed at one of the customers of the organization sending the notification, with the traffic from the host in question contributing approximately 94.0 Mbps to the overall attack. The description mentions that the overall botnet attack size was Nx10Gbps, causing significant packet loss and necessitating an emergency null-route operation to mitigate. This directly aligns with the definition of a Denial of Service Attack as provided under CAT3, which includes volumetric DoS or DDoS attacks. \n\nThe details provided, such as the involvement of a botnet, the specific mention of traffic saturation, and the need for mitigation efforts, support the classification under CAT3. There is no primary indication of the other categories being directly relevant, such as account compromise (CAT1), malware infection (CAT2), data leak (CAT4), or others, although some of these might be indirectly related (e.g., the host might have been compromised via a vulnerability). However, the main and immediate issue at hand is the DDoS attack, making CAT3 the most appropriate category."

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.

    "resposta": "Category: CAT5\nExplanation: The incident involves a vulnerability exploitation in a PaperCut NG/MF system, specifically CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351, which allow attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code. This matches the definition of CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation – using technical flaws for attacks, particularly remote code execution (RCE) without authentication. The description explicitly mentions that researchers have identified a vulnerable instance inside the network and provides evidence that the vulnerability is being actively exploited. \n\nThe description provided directly correlates with the characteristics of CAT5:\n- It mentions specific CVEs (CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351) related to a vulnerability in PaperCut NG/MF Systems.\n- The vulnerability allows for authentication bypass and execution of arbitrary code, fitting the remote code execution (RCE) example given for CAT5.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate category for this incident is CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation."

    "resposta": "Category: CAT3\nExplanation: The incident described involves a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, specifically a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The attack was carried out using a botnet, which included a compromised host under the control of the recipient of the email. The attack caused significant packet loss for the targeted customers and required an emergency null-route operation to mitigate. This matches the definition of CAT3: Denial of Service Attack, which includes volumetric DoS or DDoS attacks. \n\nThe details provided in the incident description, such as the mention of a coordinated DDoS botnet, the involvement of multiple compromised hosts, and the impact on network availability, further support the classification as a CAT3 incident. The description also mentions possible sources of the compromise, such as vulnerable devices or servers, but the primary nature of the incident is the DDoS attack itself, which falls under CAT3."

Specifically, the mention of a brute-force attack against SSH (a type of credential phishing) supports this classification. \n\nThe CERT.br email is requesting the responsible party to investigate and correct the issue, implying that there was a potential security breach, likely through a compromised account or vulnerability that allowed the brute-force attack to succeed.

    "resposta": "Category: CAT3: Denial of Service Attack\n\nExplanation: The incident description clearly indicates that a Denial of Service (DoS) attack occurred, specifically a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The text mentions that an IP address under the control of the recipient appears to have been part of a coordinated DDoS botnet attack, which targeted one of the sender's customers. The attack involved a significant amount of traffic (~94.0 Mbps) and was described as causing \"significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.\" This required an emergency null-route operation to mitigate. The description matches the examples provided for CAT3, such as a volumetric DoS or DDoS attack. \n\nAdditionally, the description discusses potential sources of the compromise, such as a compromised router, IoT device, webhost, DVR, IPMI device, or server with insecure passwords, which were used to conduct the DDoS attack. However, the primary nature of the incident reported is the DDoS attack itself, making CAT3 the most appropriate category. \n\nThe details about possible vulnerabilities and compromises leading to the DDoS could also relate to CAT5 (Vulnerability Exploitation), but the immediate and direct impact described is a DDoS attack, not the exploitation of vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control. Therefore, CAT3 directly addresses the incident's nature as described."

This suggests that an attacker gained unauthorized access to the machine, which aligns with the definition of Account Compromise (CAT1). Specifically, the mention of a brute-force attack against SSH is an example of credential phishing or SSH brute force, which are both listed as examples of CAT1. \n\nThe logs provided also show multiple SYN packets being sent from the machine to various IP addresses, which is consistent with a compromised machine being used to initiate connections for malicious purposes. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, CAT1: Account Compromise is the most appropriate category for this incident."

The description explicitly mentions that \"A maquina em questao foi vitima de um ataque de forca bruta contra o SSH,\" which translates to \"The machine in question was a victim of a brute-force attack against SSH.\" This matches the examples provided for CAT1, which include SSH brute force as a form of unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n\nThe description also provides logs that show multiple connection attempts from the same IP address to various destinations, further supporting the suspicion of a brute-force attack. Therefore, the incident aligns with the definition of CAT1: Account Compromise – unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts, specifically through a brute-force attack on SSH, which is listed as an example under this category."

It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

    "resposta": "Category: CAT3: Denial of Service Attack\n\nExplanation: The incident description clearly indicates that a Denial of Service (DoS) attack occurred, specifically a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The text mentions that an IP address under the control of the recipient appears to have been part of a coordinated DDoS botnet attack, which targeted one of the sender's customers. The attack involved a significant amount of traffic (~94.0 Mbps) and was described as causing \"significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation.\" This required an emergency null-route operation to mitigate. The description matches the examples provided for CAT3, such as a volumetric DoS or DDoS attack. \n\nAdditionally, the description provides details about potential sources of the compromise, such as vulnerable devices or servers, but the primary nature of the incident reported is the DDoS attack itself, making CAT3 the most appropriate classification."
