We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds.

It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

    "resposta": "Category: CAT5 (Vulnerability Exploitation)\n\nExplanation:\nThe incident describes the identification of a vulnerability (CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351) in PaperCut NG/MF systems that allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. It involves exploiting known security flaws to gain unauthorized control over the system without prior account compromise. The communication centers around vulnerability detection, validation via specific HTTP requests, and recommendations to remediate the CVEs, with no indication that any accounts were accessed, credentials stolen, or brute force attacks attempted.\n\n---\n\nInstructions specify considering Category CAT1 with keywords related to account compromise. Proceeding with hypothesis evaluation:\n\n1. True Hypothesis (Incident belongs to CAT1 - Account Compromise):  \n- Justification: The incident involves authentication bypass, which might imply unauthorized access. However, the report indicates the vulnerability was detected by researchers, there is no evidence that user or admin accounts were compromised or credentials stolen, no mention of phishing, brute force, or suspicious login activity. The incident focuses on vulnerability exploitation rather than confirmed account compromise.  \n- Assessment: NOT SUPPORTED\n\n2.

CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351 allow attackers to bypass authentication and leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in SYSTEM context on the underlying operating system. There is evidence to support the claim that this vulnerability is actively being exploited by criminals. To remediate this vulnerability, please follow the steps mentioned in the PaperCut advisory below. Scan data: Host: [IP_ADDRESS_57adadc47a] Timestamp rescan: 2023-04-24T14:19:10.05250055+02:00 We determined the vulnerability by performing a GET-request to a specific URI on your system. The combination of HTTP response code 200 and the response containing a setup page indicated presence of the vulnerability. No damage or harm to your systems has been made.

Keywords such as \"vulnerable,\" \"CVE,\" \"bypass authentication,\" \"execute arbitrary code,\" and \"vulnerability\" directly align with the definition of CAT5 (Vulnerability Exploitation). The incident is focused on a security flaw that can be exploited to gain unauthorized system-level access, which fits squarely within this category.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The detailed evidence in the description of known CVEs, exploitation method, and potential for remote code execution contradicts the exclusion from CAT5. Since there is clear mention of a technical flaw enabling exploitation, dismissing it as not belonging to CAT5 lacks support. Therefore, the hypothesis that this incident does not belong in CAT5 is not supported."

This indicates unauthorized modification of website content.\n\n**CAT5 Definition:** This category involves exploitation of technical flaws such as CVEs, remote code execution, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities allowing remote exploitation without authentication.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: True Hypothesis (Assuming CAT5 applies)\n\n- The incident involves a website content alteration (defacement), which frequently results from exploitation of vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, remote code execution).\n- However, the description does not explicitly mention exploitation of a vulnerability, security flaw, or a technical vector such as CVE, RCE, or injection.\n- The word \"exploit,\" \"vulnerability,\" \"cve,\" \"remote execution,\" \"sql injection,\" or similar do not appear in the text.\n- Without explicit mention or evidence of a technical flaw exploitation, the hypothesis that this incident is clearly CAT5 is weak even though it is a plausible cause behind defacement.\n\n**Conclusion:** The True Hypothesis that this is a CAT5 incident is **NOT SUPPORTED** due to lack of explicit evidence of vulnerability exploitation.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: False Hypothesis (Assuming CAT5 does NOT apply)\n\n- The incident describes unauthorized modification (defacement), which fits more naturally under **CAT9: Unauthorized Modification**.\n- No direct mention of technical flaw exploitation is provided.\n- The incident could stem from other causes like compromised credentials (CAT1) or insider actions (CAT6), but no such indications are present either.\n- Since no evidence supports exploitation of a security vulnerability, it is reasonable to assume this is *not* CAT5.\n  \n**Conclusion:** The False Hypothesis that this incident does *not* belong to CAT5 is **SUPPORTED** based on lack of evidence referencing vulnerabilities or exploit activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Output:\n\n```\nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED\n```"

True Hypothesis:  \nAssuming the incident is a social engineering attack (e.g., phishing, vishing, CEO fraud, or manipulation), the justification would require evidence of deception or trickery aimed at gaining access or information by manipulating people. However, the incident description shows a website content alteration report without any explicit indication of social engineering methods used such as phishing emails or fraud attempts. The report focuses on unauthorized content changes, not on deception against users or administrators.  \nConclusion: True Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED\n\n2. False Hypothesis:  \nAssuming the incident is not a social engineering attack, this fits because there is no indication of phishing, fraud, or manipulation in the incident text. The issue described is a website defacement, which is more aligned with unauthorized modification rather than social engineering tactics.  \nConclusion: False Hypothesis: SUPPORTED\n\n---\n\nFinal hypotheses:  \nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

    "resposta": "Category Classification:  \n**CAT3: Denial of Service Attack**  \n\nJustification:  \nThe incident description reports an IP address under control of the recipient being used to participate in a coordinated DDoS attack, which is a volumetric attack aimed at overwhelming the victim’s network. The description explicitly mentions a botnet attack generating traffic at approximately 94 Mbps from the compromised host, contributing to a larger multi-gigabit attack that caused significant service disruption for the attacked customers. This fits the NIST category CAT3: Denial of Service Attack, covering volumetric DDoS using botnets to flood targets and cause service unavailability.\n\n---\n\n### Considering CAT1: Account Compromise\n\n**True Hypothesis:**   \n- The incident mentions the possibility that the source device was compromised either due to weak/default credentials (such as default admin usernames and passwords on routers or devices), or via brute forcing (e.g., SSH, RDP).  \n- These example methods align closely with CAT1 examples like credential phishing, brute force, unauthorized access, compromised password, and account compromise.  \n- However, no direct evidence in the incident states actual compromised user/admin accounts or token theft, only speculation about device compromise routes.  \n**Verdict:** True Hypothesis: **NOT SUPPORTED** — The description lacks definitive evidence of account/user credential compromise; it focuses on device compromise and malicious use.\n\n**False Hypothesis:**  \n- The incident does not confirm unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts but rather reports compromised devices being used in a DDoS attack.  \n- The main attack vector is not about stolen credentials or compromised accounts but infected or vulnerable devices forming a botnet.  \n- Therefore, the incident does not support classification under CAT1.  \n**Verdict:** False Hypothesis: **SUPPORTED**\n\n---\n\n### Final output:\n\nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

The presence of SSH brute force attempts aligns directly with the examples listed under CAT1: Account Compromise. The email warns about malicious activity originating from the machine, possibly due to compromise or misuse by a legitimate user, reinforcing the account compromise nature of the attack.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: There is clear evidence in the logs and description that an SSH brute force attack has occurred, indicating an attempt to gain unauthorized access. Therefore, it is unsupported to claim the incident does not belong to CAT1, as the attack type and behavior match the category definition."

Instead, it reports the identification of a vulnerability (authentication bypass) that could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. No evidence of malware presence or infection is provided.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident primarily concerns the detection and reporting of a vulnerability (CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351) that allows authentication bypass and possible remote code execution. There is explicit mention that no damage or harm was made to systems and no malware infection was observed. Thus, it is supported that this incident does NOT belong to the Malware category since it is about a vulnerability exploitation risk rather than an actual malware infection."

    "resposta": "Category: CAT5 – Vulnerability Exploitation\n\nExplanation:  \nThe incident describes the identification of a vulnerable PaperCut NG/MF system affected by CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. The description explicitly mentions exploitation of these critical CVEs, the presence of a security flaw, remote code execution capability, and evidence of active exploitation attempts. Thus, the incident aligns perfectly with CAT5, which covers exploiting technical flaws such as critical CVEs and remote code execution vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n1. True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The description includes keywords and concepts directly linked to CAT5, including \"vulnerability,\" \"CVE-2023-27350,\" \"CVE-2023-27351,\" \"authentication bypass,\" and \"execute arbitrary code.\" The identified security flaws have been validated by scanning and documented exploit paths, confirming the hypothesis that this is a vulnerability exploitation incident.\n\n2. False Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: There is strong and clear evidence in the description that the incident involves exploitation of known vulnerabilities through critical CVEs leading to potential remote code execution. Rejecting category CAT5 contradicts the incident facts and supporting technical data.\n\n---\n\nFinal output:\n\nTrue Hypothesis:[SUPPORTED]  \nFalse Hypothesis:[NOT SUPPORTED]"

True Hypothesis for CAT2 (Malware):  \n- Assume the incident belongs to CAT2.  \n- Justification: The provided description does not mention or indicate any malware infection, malicious code presence, ransomware, virus, trojan, or spyware activity. The main issue is the defacement (content alteration) of the website, not infection by malicious code. Therefore, the hypothesis that this is a malware incident is unsupported.  \n- Status: NOT SUPPORTED  \n\n2. False Hypothesis for CAT2 (Malware):  \n- Assume the incident does NOT belong to CAT2.  \n- Justification: The description clearly identifies alteration of the website content (defacement), and no mention or evidence of malware infection or any malicious code is present. Hence, it is reasonable to exclude malware infection as the root cause.  \n- Status: SUPPORTED  \n\nFinal Output:\n\nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

    "resposta": "Category Classification: CAT9 - Unauthorized Modification\n\nExplanation:  \nThe incident describes a case of website content being altered without authorization, commonly referred to as website defacement. This fits the definition of CAT9, which includes defacement and improper changes to systems or data. There is no indication in the description of data being exfiltrated or exposed, so categories related to data leak (CAT4) do not directly apply.\n\n---\n\nAnalysis Regarding CAT4 (Data Leak):\n\n1. True Hypothesis (Incident belongs to CAT4):  \n- Justification: The description does not mention any sensitive data being leaked or exposed. The main issue is that the website content was altered (defaced), not that data was disclosed or stolen. Therefore, there is no evidence of unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data, data exfiltration, or leaked credentials.  \n- Conclusion: NOT SUPPORTED\n\n2. False Hypothesis (Incident does NOT belong to CAT4):  \n- Justification: Based on the incident narrative, no data leak or exposure is mentioned. The problem is unauthorized modification of website content, rather than leakage of sensitive information. Therefore, it is justified to consider that the incident does not fall under the Data Leak category.  \n- Conclusion: SUPPORTED\n\n---\n\nFinal Output:\n\nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

    "resposta": "The incident description reports that the website content was altered (\"desfiguração de website\"), and that the altered content remained accessible. The communication requests investigation and corrective actions. There is no explicit mention of exploitation of vulnerabilities, CVEs, remote code execution, SQL injection, or similar technical attack methods.\n\n**Step 1: True Hypothesis (CAT5 - Vulnerability Exploitation)**  \n- Justification: CAT5 involves attacks exploiting technical flaws such as CVEs, remote code execution, SQL injection, or other vulnerabilities. The incident describes a website defacement (content alteration), which often results from exploiting a vulnerability. However, the description does not explicitly mention any exploitation of vulnerabilities or technical flaws, no indication of a CVE being exploited, nor any details about the attack vector. The description is ambiguous and only states that content was changed, which could result from multiple causes including unauthorized modification or insider abuse as well.  \n- Verdict: **NOT SUPPORTED** – Because no explicit evidence or mention of \"exploit,\" \"vulnerability,\" \"CVE,\" \"remote execution,\" or related keywords is present to support CAT5.\n\n**Step 2: False Hypothesis (Incident does NOT belong to CAT5)**  \n- Justification: Since the incident report lacks evidence or indication of an exploited technical vulnerability or security flaw, it is reasonable to reject the classification as CAT5. The incident better fits other categories such as CAT9 (Unauthorized Modification), given that the main observed symptom is content alteration (defacement). The absence of explicit evidence for vulnerability exploitation supports this hypothesis.  \n- Verdict: **SUPPORTED**\n\n---\n\n**Final Output:**  \nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

This matches CAT9's description of defacement and improper changes to systems or data.\n\n---\n\nRegarding CAT7 (Social Engineering):\n\n1. True Hypothesis:  \nAssuming the incident belongs to CAT7 would require evidence of deception tactics such as phishing, vishing, CEO fraud, or social engineering attacks to gain access or data. The provided description does not mention any social engineering attempts or related keywords like phishing, fraud, or manipulation. It focuses solely on website defacement.  \n**True Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED**\n\n2. False Hypothesis:  \nAssuming the incident does NOT belong to CAT7 is justifiable due to the absence of any indicators or evidence of social engineering activities in the incident description. No mention of phishing or deceptive tactics. The incident relates to unauthorized content modification but not to manipulation or fraud techniques involving human deception.  \n**False Hypothesis: SUPPORTED**\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\nTrue Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED"

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

Several possible vectors are mentioned, including compromised devices via default or weak credentials (e.g., default admin username and password on routers, brute-forced server passwords over SSH or RDP, and compromised IPMI devices using default credentials). This aligns with the CAT1 category which involves unauthorized access to accounts—especially through brute-force or stolen/compromised credentials. The mention of brute-force SSH and use of default admin credentials reinforces this classification.\n\n---\n\n1. True Hypothesis: \nAssuming the incident belongs to CAT1 (Account Compromise) is SUPPORTED because:  \n- The incident details compromised devices due to insecure or default credentials being exploited.  \n- It explicitly mentions brute force attempts (SSH, RDP), default admin usernames/passwords, and compromised accounts as vectors of attack.  \n- The presence of unauthorized use of devices in a botnet implies successful unauthorized access, a core trait of account compromise.\n\nTrue Hypothesis: SUPPORTED\n\n---\n\n2. False Hypothesis:  \nAssuming the incident does NOT belong to CAT1 is NOT SUPPORTED because:  \n- There is clear evidence of unauthorized access due to compromised credentials and brute-forcing.  \n- The incident identifies unauthorized use of accounts/devices as the root cause, which contradicts the false hypothesis.  \n- Potential credential compromise and brute force are entire focus points of the analysis and explanation.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED"

There is no indication or mention of compromised accounts, phishing, brute force, token theft, suspicious login, or any form of credential theft or unauthorized access to user accounts. The focus is on a technical vulnerability exploitation rather than account compromise.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- There is no evidence of account compromise or related activities in the description. The incident outlines a vulnerability identification and notification process without reporting any actual account access issues.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT5  \nExplanation: The incident is best categorized as Vulnerability Exploitation (CAT5), since the primary issue involves a critical security flaw (authentication bypass) allowing remote code execution, which is a direct exploitation of a known CVE vulnerability. There is no indication of account compromise, malware infection, or other categories listed. The report focuses on technical flaw exploitation and notification for remediation."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The incident description clearly reports possible infection by the malware SystemBC, which is described as a backdoor malware used in ransomware attacks (Ryuk and Egregor). It mentions interaction of the malware with hosts, recommends blocking compromised accounts, isolating infected machines, and reinstalling software with updated antivirus protection—all indicative of a malware infection incident. Keywords like \"malware,\" \"SystemBC,\" \"backdoor,\" and references to ransomware confirm this classification under CAT2 (Malware).\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The description provides explicit evidence of malware presence and impact on infected hosts in the network. The communication details logs indicating victim IPs and Windows accounts possibly infected, and the recommended incident response actions align with malware containment and remediation. There is no lack of evidence supporting malware infection, so assuming it does not belong to CAT2 contradicts the incident details.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident is categorized as CAT2 because it describes an infection by the malware SystemBC, a known backdoor used in ransomware campaigns, indicating a clear case of malicious code infection impacting hosts within the network. The recommended actions and observed behaviors are consistent with a malware incident requiring containment and eradication."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description clearly states \"Desfiguracao de website\" which translates to \"website defacement.\" Defacement is an unauthorized modification of website content, matching the CAT9 definition.\n- The message reports that the website content was altered and continues to be accessible in the altered state.\n- Keywords such as \"alterado\" (altered), \"desfiguração\" (defacement), and the note on modified content directly confirm unauthorized changes.\n- This aligns precisely with CAT9: Unauthorized Modification – improper changes such as defacement.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- There is clear evidence of unauthorized modification (defacement).\n- The incident is not about compromise of accounts alone, malware infection, DoS, data leak, or other categories.\n- Thus, the hypothesis that this is not a CAT9 incident is not supported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT9  \nExplanation: The incident describes unauthorized modification of a website’s content (defacement), as the site’s content was altered without authorization and remains available in this altered state. This aligns directly with CAT9: Unauthorized Modification, characterized by improper changes to systems or data such as defacement. The evidence supports classification under CAT9."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description focuses on a compromised host used as a source of a large-scale DDoS attack. The indicators are around compromised devices (routers, DVRs, IPMI, webhosts) being used in a botnet to flood targets with traffic, causing denial of service. Although compromise is implied (due to default passwords, vulnerabilities, outdated software), there is no direct mention of account compromise, credential theft, phishing, suspicious login, brute force of accounts, or token misuse. The keywords related to CAT1 are absent or not the primary vector described. The incident instead highlights use of compromised devices, not directly compromised user accounts or credentials.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident lacks evidence of unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts specifically, such as through phishing, brute force attacks on accounts, or credential theft. The compromise appears to be at the device or service level (vulnerabilities, default passwords, trojans), focused on device takeover for use in a botnet, not account compromise as defined in CAT1.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: UNKNOWN  \nExplanation: UNKNOWN"

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description references a compromised host that was used in a coordinated DDoS botnet attack. It mentions specific examples of compromised devices, including routers with backdoors, trojan downloaded apps, vulnerable firmware, and compromised webhosts possibly infected via vulnerabilities. The presence of trojans, compromised devices, and references to malware-related infections strongly align with the \"Malware\" category as defined in CAT2 (infection by malicious code, including trojan horse).  \n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The description clearly indicates the involvement of compromised devices infected or controlled by malicious code (trojans, backdoors, vulnerable firmware), justifying malware infection. It is not lacking evidence of malware involvement.  \n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident involves a compromised host infected or controlled by malicious code, such as trojans or vulnerable firmware, which was used as part of a large DDoS botnet attack. This fits the CAT2 category of Malware, which includes infections by trojans and malicious code that enable unauthorized botnet activity."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The incident description details a compromised host used to perform a volumetric DDoS attack as part of a botnet. Although the attack stems from a compromised device, there is no direct evidence or mention of account compromise such as phishing, brute force of user credentials, token theft, or unauthorized access to specific accounts. The scenario emphasizes device compromise and misuse rather than unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The incident focuses on a compromised host involved in a distributed denial of service attack, with potential causes including vulnerable devices, default credentials on network hardware, or outdated firmware leading to compromise. However, there is no clear evidence referencing credential theft, brute force of accounts, or unauthorized login activity, indicating the incident does not fit the Account Compromise category.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: UNKNOWN  \nExplanation: The incident is primarily about a compromised device used in a DDoS attack linked to malware or vulnerability exploitation rather than explicit account compromise indicators such as phishing, brute force attacks, or credential theft. Therefore, classification under CAT1 (Account Compromise) is not sufficiently supported."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident describes a compromised host used in a coordinated DDoS botnet attack. The description explicitly lists potential causes including compromised routers running vulnerable firmware, compromised devices due to trojan downloaded apps, vulnerable webhosts running vulnerable versions of Drupal, WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel, compromised DVRs, and other compromised standalone devices. Trojans and other malware infections are directly mentioned or implied as the root cause of these compromises, which aligns with the definition of CAT2 (Malware – infection by malicious code). The keywords \"trojan\", \"compromised\", and references to malicious code infection are present.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The incident report contains multiple explicit indications that malicious code (e.g., trojans, vulnerable firmware allowing compromise) is involved in the host's participation in the botnet attack. Thus, denying the malware involvement would contradict described evidence.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident involves compromised hosts used in a botnet for DDoS attacks due to infections by malicious code (e.g., trojans, vulnerable firmware, malware), fitting the CAT2 category of Malware infections. The description supports this classification by detailing possible malware infection vectors and compromised devices."

Thus, there is sufficient evidence supporting the incident as an account compromise rather than the absence of it.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT1  \nExplanation: The incident involves a brute force attack against SSH, which is a clear example of account compromise as defined by CAT1.

The description states this allows attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges—this directly matches exploitation of a security flaw and remote code execution (RCE). Furthermore, evidence of active exploitation by criminals is mentioned. This aligns perfectly with Category 5 “Vulnerability Exploitation,” which includes exploiting critical CVEs and RCE vulnerabilities.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: There is ample evidence in the report, including CVE identifiers, attack vector details, and references to remote execution vulnerabilities. The absence of this category would ignore the core nature of the incident, making the false hypothesis unsupported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT5  \nExplanation: The incident involves the exploitation of known vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351) in PaperCut NG/MF systems that enable attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code remotely. This precisely matches the definition of Category 5 – Vulnerability Exploitation – as it leverages technical security flaws to compromise the system."

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate. Attacks like this are usually made very short, intentionally, so that they are not as noticeable and slip past certain automatic mitigation systems. From your side, you would be able to observe the attack as a burst of traffic that likely saturated the network adapter of the source device for perhaps 30 seconds. Since the source device is a member of a botnet that is being used for many attacks, you will see many other mysterious bursts of outbound traffic, as well.

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident describes a compromised host being used as part of a DDoS botnet, which is typically formed by malware infections (botnet malware) on devices such as routers, DVRs, webhosts, and other vulnerable devices. The text explicitly references trojan apps, vulnerable firmware, and compromised devices, indicating malicious code infection and control. Keywords such as \"trojan,\" \"compromised,\" \"vulnerable,\" and \"infection\" strongly support classification under Malware (CAT2).\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The description clearly shows evidence of malware infection (botnet malware) controlling the host for coordinated DDoS attacks. Thus, denying malware involvement contradicts the detailed explanation and evidence provided.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident involves a compromised host infected with malicious code such as trojans and vulnerable firmware, which are classic signs of malware infection. The host is part of a botnet coordinating large-scale DDoS attacks, further supporting classification under Malware (CAT2)."

The message also suggests possible compromise of the machine or unauthorized use by a legitimate user contrary to network policy, indicating unauthorized access attempts. Keywords such as \"compromised,\" \"SSH,\" \"brute force,\" and \"account compromise\" are present and clearly point to CAT1.  \n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: There is clear evidence of an SSH brute force attack and likely compromise of user accounts or credentials. The logs show multiple connection attempts consistent with brute force activity, and the alert is from a CERT team clearly indicating suspicious account-related activity. Therefore, assuming the incident does NOT belong to CAT1 is not supported by the evidence.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT1  \nExplanation: The incident involves an SSH brute force attack against the machine, consistent with unauthorized access attempts leading to account compromise. The presence of brute force attempts and possible compromised credentials align directly with CAT1: Account Compromise. The alert from CERT.br and supporting logs confirm that this category best represents the incident described."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \nJustification: The incident description explicitly mentions \"Desfiguracao de website,\" which translates to \"website defacement.\" Website defacement involves unauthorized modification of website content, fitting well within the scope of CAT9: Unauthorized Modification. The altered content is still accessible, confirming that unauthorized changes were made to the website. The keywords \"altered,\" \"defacement,\" and \"modification\" strongly align with the incident details.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \nJustification: There is clear evidence of unauthorized changes (defacement) to the website content, so assuming it does NOT belong to CAT9 contradicts the described facts. Therefore, this hypothesis is NOT SUPPORTED.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT9  \nExplanation: The incident describes a case of website defacement, which is an unauthorized modification of system content. This fits precisely within CAT9: Unauthorized Modification, as the website's content was altered without permission, prompting investigation and corrective action."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description refers to a compromised host being used as part of a coordinated DDoS botnet attack. It lists many possible compromised devices, including routers, IPMI devices, DVRs, webhosts infected by vulnerable software, trojans in apps, and other compromised standalone devices.  \n- The mention of trojan downloaded apps, vulnerable firmware, and compromised devices infected and controlled remotely strongly suggests the involvement of malware or malicious code leading to infection and control by attackers.  \n- The description fits CAT2 (Malware) because the compromised hosts are infected with malicious code (trojans, backdoors, vulnerable firmware) that allows attackers to use them as part of the botnet.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The incident explicitly mentions compromised devices with likely malware infections (trojan apps, backdoor firmware, vulnerable webapps exploited by malware), making the absence of malware unlikely.  \n- The evidence in the description directly implicates malware or malicious code as the cause of the compromise.  \n- Therefore, the hypothesis that the incident does NOT belong to CAT2 is not supported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident describes a compromised host used in a botnet DDoS attack, where multiple possible infection vectors involve malware such as trojan apps, backdoor firmware, and vulnerable web services exploited by malicious code. This clearly aligns with CAT2 (Malware), as the root cause is infection and control of devices through malicious code to participate in attacks."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description explicitly mentions \"Authentication Bypass in PaperCut NG/MF Systems,\" referencing CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351, which are known vulnerabilities allowing attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code (RCE) in SYSTEM context. The presence of terms like \"vulnerable,\" \"exploit,\" \"CVE,\" and potential \"remote code execution\" aligns directly with exploiting a technical flaw. The report describes a scan confirming the vulnerability by HTTP response and setup page presence, confirming that this is an exploitation of a critical CVE without evidence of actual damage yet. This matches perfectly with CAT5: Vulnerability Exploitation.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- Given the explicit mention of confirmed vulnerabilities, CVEs, and the nature of the security flaw, there is clear evidence that this incident belongs to CAT5. The false hypothesis disregards the clear connection to vulnerability exploitation, which is contradicted by the detailed findings.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT5  \nExplanation: The incident involves confirmed exploitation of known vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-27350 and CVE-2023-27351) in PaperCut NG/MF systems enabling authentication bypass and remote code execution, a textbook example of vulnerability exploitation as defined by CAT5. The detailed proof of concept using HTTP requests and identification of the flaw supports classification as Vulnerability Exploitation."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description explicitly mentions that the hosts are \"possivelmente comprometidos pelo malware SystemBC.\" SystemBC is described as a malware/backdoor used in ransomware attacks (Ryuk and Egregor). The terms \"malware,\" \"infected,\" \"backdoor,\" and references to infection and malicious code are present and clearly indicate a malware infection scenario. Therefore, classifying it as CAT2: Malware is consistent with the provided description.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- There is strong evidence in the incident for the presence of malware infection and its impact, thus it is unlikely that this incident does NOT belong to the malware category. The detailed mention of SystemBC malware infection and its usage in lateral movement and ransomware attacks negates the idea of absence of malware.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident clearly involves infection by malicious code (SystemBC malware), identified by CERT.br, which is used as a backdoor facilitating lateral movement and associated with ransomware attacks. The presence of malware and associated risk matches the definition and scope of CAT2 (Malware), making this the most appropriate classification."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description discusses a compromised host used in a coordinated DDoS botnet attack. It mentions multiple types of compromised devices, including routers, web hosts running vulnerable CMS platforms (Drupal, WordPress, phpMyAdmin), devices with vulnerable or trojaned firmware, and other compromised standalone devices. The reference to compromised devices running trojan applications and vulnerable firmware strongly implies infection by malicious code. The involvement of a botnet coordinating attacks typically requires malware to compromise and control these hosts. Keywords such as \"trojan,\" \"compromised,\" and \"vulnerable\" firmware, and the description of an infected host within a botnet align with the CAT2 category definition (malware infection).\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- There is ample evidence in the description pointing towards infection by malicious code. The narrative explicitly discusses compromised hosts potentially infected by trojans or vulnerable firmware. The presence of a botnet built from many infected devices further supports malware involvement. Thus, the hypothesis that this is not a malware-related incident is not supported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident involves a compromised host used in a DDoS attack as part of a botnet. The description details multiple potential malware infections (trojans, vulnerable firmware, compromised devices), which fits the NIST CAT2 definition of malware infection. Therefore, classifying this incident as CAT2 is justified."

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description explicitly mentions that the machine was a victim of an SSH brute force attack, which directly relates to unauthorized access attempts and account compromise efforts. The keywords \"brute force\" and \"SSH\" are clearly present, matching the criteria for CAT1. The message warns the recipient that the machine is likely compromised or misused by a legitimate user in violation of network policies, reinforcing the connection to account compromise.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- There is concrete evidence in the description of malicious activity consistent with account compromise patterns, specifically an SSH brute force attack and potential unauthorized access. Therefore, assuming the incident does not belong to CAT1 contradicts the provided evidence and is not supported.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT1  \nExplanation: The incident involves a brute force attack against SSH, which is a classic method for attempting unauthorized access and credential compromise. This aligns directly with the CAT1 category definition of Account Compromise, supported by the presence of related keywords and the attack nature described."

We manually reviewed the captures from this attack and do not believe that your IP address was spoofed, based on the limited number of distinct hosts attacking us, the identicality of many attacking IP addresses to ones we've seen in the past, and the non-random distribution of IP addresses. It is possible that this host is one of the following, from the responses that others have sent us: - A compromised router, such as a [ORGANIZATION_4fa360a1dd] that is running with WAN access enabled; a [ORGANIZATION_9954db40ae] which still allows a default admin username and password; a Netis, with a built-in internet-accessible backdoor ([URL_2764a7b048]); or one running an old AirOS version with a vulnerable and exposed administrative interface - An [ORGANIZATION_8df3b93efb] device that is vulnerable to compromise (such as HTV), either directly through the default firmware or through a trojan downloaded app - A compromised webhost, such as one running a vulnerable version of Drupal (for instance, using the vulnerability discussed at [URL_9346d9f602]), WordPress, phpMyAdmin, or zPanel - A compromised DVR, such as a \"Hikvision\" brand device (ref: [URL_4d5849d65d]) - A compromised IPMI device, such as one made by [ORGANIZATION_e8804ebb01] (possibly because it uses the default U/P of ADMIN/ADMIN or because its password was found through an exploit described at [URL_643058c363]) - A compromised Xerox-branded device - Some other compromised standalone device - A server with an insecure password that was brute-forced, such as through SSH or RDP - A server running an improperly secured Hadoop installation - A server running a pre-13.10.3 GitLab instance that is vulnerable to CVE-2021-22205 - A compromised [ORGANIZATION_c7bac46904] DNS server (through the July 2020 critical vulnerability) The overall botnet attack was Nx10Gbps in size (with traffic from your host as well as some others) and caused significant packet loss for our clients due to external link saturation. It required an emergency null-route operation on our side to mitigate.

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The incident describes an IP address under control of the reported organization participating in a large-scale DDoS attack as part of a botnet. While compromised hosts are mentioned, there is no direct evidence of account compromise such as credential phishing, brute force on accounts, stolen tokens, or suspicious logins mentioned in the description. The focus is on a compromised device or host used for network-based attacks rather than unauthorized access to user or administrator accounts.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident lacks indicators of account compromise or unauthorized access through credentials.

    "resposta": "True Hypothesis: SUPPORTED  \n- The incident description references a \"compromised host used for an attack\" that is part of a coordinated DDoS botnet. It also lists multiple examples of compromised devices including routers, DVRs, webhosts, IPMI devices, and mentions trojan apps and vulnerable firmware versions. These points indicate that the compromised devices are infected by malicious code or malware, enabling them to participate in the attack. Keywords like \"trojan,\" \"compromised,\" and references to vulnerable and infected devices strongly align with malware infection as the underlying cause.\n\nFalse Hypothesis: NOT SUPPORTED  \n- The evidence provided in the incident clearly documents infection and compromise of devices by malicious code or trojans. Therefore, assuming the incident does NOT belong to CAT2 (Malware) is not supported because the description explicitly suggests an infection-driven compromise as the root cause of the DDoS attack.\n\nFinal Classification Decision:  \nCategory: CAT2  \nExplanation: The incident involves devices compromised through infection by malicious code (e.g., trojans, vulnerable firmware exploited by malware), which enables their participation in a botnet conducting a DDoS attack. The presence of trojan apps and references to various infected devices confirms malware infection as the cause, fitting well within CAT2: Malware."
